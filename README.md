Implement Gradient Descent Algorithm in Python

To know more about derivates check the tutorial on [Mathisforfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/derivatives-introduction.html)

Formulas for cost function and the partial derviates can be found [here](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html)
